                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong>What are Virtual Influencers ? What is the future of virtual influencing ?</strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The expectations of human competing with robots have been into the minds of humans for a long time. Though we don't see the robots competing for the job of a waiter at a restaurant or a machine in human figure fighting in the army in the near future, there has been a section where we see the humans and the virtual humans interacting with each other, and this section is the world of influencers.
<br>
<br><strong>WHO ARE VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS?</strong>
<br>
<br>The virtual influencers or CGI influencers are graphically generated characters that are mostly used in gaming industry or digital marketing. For years we have been hearing "Fake it to make it" but these words never were so true as of now in the world of digital platforms where the virtual characters have been getting so much of attention all around. Previously the digital marketing campaigns revolved only around celebrities or other famous people, but as the world is progressing so is the scene of digital marketing world. We have begun to experience the craze of virtual influencers who are taking over the internet with their millions of followers. These characters are totally controlled by the company to which they belong to. These companies are the actual ones to make the deal and let the characters perform by the help of codes.
<br>
<br><strong>Future Prospects Of Virtual Influencers.</strong>
<br>
<br>The world is changing at a very fast pace. The changes are happening at such a tremendous pace that now brands offer millions of dollars to them who don't even exist. Yes! It's shocking but it's true. As of now influencers like lilmiquela are earning tens of millions of dollars through brand endorsement and such brand campaigns are proving to be successful. It may be hard to digest but the world of digital marketing and influencing seems to go under the dominance of these virtual characters that exist only in the digital and graphical world. There has also been a sudden increase in the demand of the talents who are well proficient in Computer Generated Imagery. Many educational platforms have also announced their courses on the aforesaid. The kind of response that people are showing towards the virtual influencers and the kind of success they have been receiving shows that now the digital marketing would take a permanent curve and would give a lot of attention to these graphical characters as they are here to stay.
<br>
<br><strong>Why Brands are choosing virtual influencers over real influencers?
</strong><br>
<br>The brand ambassadors or the celebrities who are made the face of the brands can bring tremendous changes in the outlook of people towards them. We may see a person portrayed as a well-being but the very next day he might get caught in some scandals against which he was talking about in the advertisement. Such kind of issues has been there for long and such actions affect the credibility of the brand. There is always a risk that a particular section of people who don't like this particular celebrity may not go for this brand and choose their competitor over them. Vox media also commented recently on the virtual influencers and talked about how worthy and valuable they could be for marketing strategies.
<br>
<br> In this article, Andrew Dunst, VP at the marketing and software conglomerate Sage Group, said:
<br>
<br>“You remove some of the PR risks from influencers who may do something that could impact [your] base of customers. Everything this virtual influencer does is in a controlled setting by the people who are managing that account.”
<br>
<br><strong>What is the risk?
<br></strong>
<br>The concept of virtual influencers is very new and thus this quick observation of human response towards them cannot be trusted for future. There is always a possibility that people may get bored of them just because of the reason that they are not real. We are yet to know whether the consumers are going to believe these virtual influencers as the reflection of the reality or merely as digitally generated characters. This is the biggest suspense that the digital influencing world is having. If these influencers don't prove to be credible to the consumer which in turn would mean a failure of digital marketing strategies then there might come a downward curve in this domain. The influence that they can withhold on real people would determine which way this industry will go. But the good news in this domain is that the influencer market is projected to grow from 6.0 billion in 2020 to USD 24.1 billion by 2025, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 32.0% during the forecast period. Thus the virtual influencers industry is expected to expect a boom in the positive side.
<br>

She has around 2.9 million Instagram followers and has been promoting many famous brands like Prada, Calvin Klein and Samsung.

<br>
<br>
<br><strong>HOW TO CREATE VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS?
</strong><br>
<br>The most basic thing that you might have heard a lot is to understand the audience. If there is not a proper understanding on what the actual audience wants or who actually is the audience, then there is only a bleak hope left for the success of the virtual influencer. As per the trend till now more than 40% of the followers are women aged between 17 to 40. This craze of virtual characters is also in the minds of the teenagers.
<br>The next most important thing is to generate the persona of the influencer. You need to make it clear who the character would be based on. Then comes the technical part of designing the CGI influencer. This could be done with the help of softwares like Character Creator 3d, DAZ3D and Maya. After the character is finalized, you have to then build up their social media presence to make this campaign of yours a success.&nbsp;<br></p></blockquote>
