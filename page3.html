                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Are iPhones still the world leader in the mobile industry ?
<div>Apple is the first brand that comes to our mind when we think of reliability, durability and a classy touch. Though when compared to the Chinese counterparts like MI, Realme, Vivo, Oppo etc. we see that the Apple products seem to be under qualified for the price they ask. But is it really true that the phones provided by the aforesaid Chinese brands really excel the Apple iPhone which for a newbie may look unworthy?
</div><div>Apple is one of the biggest brands in the world in the present time. And as we all know that the reason behind it is the superiority of their products in all aspects. If it is about camera then from a personal point of view a lower model of IPhone series, take it to be XR or 7s has a really better camera than many flagship models of the Chinese brands.
</div><div>The major provoking reason that makes Apple products so admiring is the security they provide. Also the quality of the iPhones feels so premium in itself. Apple has got such a brand value that merely owning an iPhone in itself is seen as a sign of success in the middle class strata of the society. Be it the processor speed or the RAM management Apple iPhones excel everywhere.
</div><div>If I say from a user’s perspective, I am quite satisfied with my iPhone SE for its premium quality, awesome camera and the very good display. Though the battery life could have been better but in all other aspects it almost reaches the pinnacle of worthiness for the price it takes in. Talking about the higher end products like iPhone 11 and other flagship models, they really provide a satisfying HD graphic in games like ‘Pubg Mobile’ or ‘Call Of Duty’. Also the iOS they provide is awesome for the regular security checks and it is almost impossible for cyber intervention to happen in these devices. Though Google Play Store has got a better hand on the applications industry, the Apple’s  app store can still be said to be a fair and better bid from the customer’s point of view for they allow only such apps to be published, over  which they can have complete authentication to boost up the security and prevent any kind of malware entering the phone and demolish the ambitions of such developers who through their apps want to  steal data from our phones.
</div><div>
</div><div>Talking about the new launch  iPhone 11, the beautiful iPhone 11 features the best camera at this price range which can be used for a number of purposes like vlogging or professional photo shooting. It features dual 12 MP Ultra Wide (13mm) and Wide (26mm) cameras with 4K video recording up to 60 fps. The Ultra Wide camera provides 120° field of view, letting you capture four times more scene, and the Wide camera provides 100% Focus Pixels for up to three times faster autofocus in low light. The iphone 11 has got all-screen Liquid Retina LCD and a glass and aluminum design.. Also, the IP68 rating ensures that is water-resistant up to 2 meters for 30 minutes. The premium looking iPhone 11 never  fails to catch the attention of the people around. It features iOS 13 operating system with A13 bionic chip processor type. The internal storage is of 64gb and like any other model it gets a 1 year  warranty. The rear camera allows 4K video recording whereas the primary dual 12 MP allows ultra wide angle camera making it so glazing to use. It also allows wireless charging.
</div><div>As per the real life user reviews a majority of them were highly satisfied with the product and its amazing speed. Though some of them complained that the display could have been better but at the end even those critics agreed that it is still very pretty and satisfying. Many of the real life vloggers and gamers found it suitable for their needs. The professionalism of the products of apple is really commendable. Even after viewing numerous reviews I couldn’t really find any major issue or area where this phone may lag behind. Also the inclusion of the latest  iOS 13 makes this phone really very fast and swift to do multitasking. The phone is really beautiful in appearance and at present it really excels any other phone in its price range. It could surely be said that it is a complete package for resourceful audience. Even if you are worried about the battery life, you need not tense as it is also praiseworthy. I should admit that this product really doesn’t disappoint at all.
</div><div>Going  a little downwards in the budget range, the next iPhone that would catch your attention is none but iPhone XR.
</div><div>“The iPhone XR would be the phone I would go for blindly, if it fits my budget.”
</div><div>“WHY ?”
</div><div>The new iPhone XR has got one of the best build quality as a special Apple-designed alloy has been utilized to make the structural bands, so as to complement the look of the back glass. The new iPhone is fully loaded with many features that are jaw dropping and would surely catch your attention. The iPhone camera has always been the center of all attention, and with the iPhone XR, the stunning cameras (12 MP Rear Camera, 7 MP Front Camera) are accompanied by an innovative sensor and Neural Engine to capture memories like never before. The front camera has got wide lens and portrait with depth control that would help you to capture the best of your selfies that you do deserve. The iPhone camera never disappoints and always brings in the best pictures. The most unbelievable part is that the video recording in this model is possible in ultra HD at 2160p. I mean isn’t it so amazing? You can use this phone camera to make even YouTube  videos without spending lakhs to buy that DSLR.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;It has LCD display with HD resolution, very bright &amp; color accurate.
</div><div>About the battery life one of the user reviewed that “And this one is an absolute battery champ and won’t let you down. Charging is also pretty fast if you use a fast charger. I use an iPad 12W charger to top it up and it goes from 10% to 90% within 90 mins.”
</div><div>The iPhone XR has got the iOS 12  operating system and is also compatible with iOS 13 and the processor type is A12 Bionic Chip. This phone is a complete package for you and don’t worry Apple never forgets to bring in the premium touch for you. I have been really impressed by this phone and maybe this is the reason why I would highly suggest you to go for it.
